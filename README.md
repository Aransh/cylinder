# Cylinder

## The free software alternative to Barrel

### Why?

Because I don't want to pay $2 for something that takes a few hours to make

### Plans for the future

This is eventually going to be a MobileSubtrate tweak with Lua bindings, but for now all this is is a cycript "script".

### I don't care, how do I use this shit?

You'll need [cycript](http://cycript.org) 0.9.5+ installed. Just copy these files to your device and

```
./runme.sh
```

If that doesn't work, then do

```
cycript -p SpringBoard
```

and paste the contents in line-by-line. sorry, this is a bug with cycript :(
