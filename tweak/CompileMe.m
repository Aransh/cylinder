//NOTE: See issue #1. This is horrible practice.
//I should just build these separately and link them,
//but when I tried it, I always got some linker error.
//It should be a easy fix for anyone who is experienced
//with MobileSubstrate tweaks, but I couldn't figure it out
//If anyone has the time, I'd appreciate it if you fixed
//this for me. Thanks.
